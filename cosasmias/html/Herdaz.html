                    Herdaz is technically Vorin, but has its own brand of Vorinism.

                    Herdazians are noted for their boastfulness as a cultural trait.

                    There was intermixing between the Parshendi and Herdazians long ago. One sign of this is the stone carapace on Herdazian fingernails. They use sparkflickers to start fires with these dark, crystalline fingernails and some kind of oil, which makes bursts of flame in the air. They also wear sparkflickers as a kind of ornament without real martial application aside from their more practical use. For example, Havarah, Dalinar's bridge lord - of mixed descent - did not wear a sparkflicker.

                    The Herdazian language and culture as a whole were originally inspired by Hispanic language.

                    Lopen has a tendency to use Herdazian words like gon, gancho, or mancha when referring to whomever he is talking.
