                    History
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alethkar was founded as Alethela in the Silver Kingdoms Epoch. It survived the Desolations, but at an unknown point was fractured into ten princedoms.
                    The founders of these princedoms were the sons of Sunmaker, making the present day Alethi great houses his descendants.
                    For centuries, Alethkar was divided into these self-governed princedoms until former King Gavilar conquered and united them. He was crowned the first king since Sunmaker, who'd cast down the Hierocracy.
                    The Alethi first encountered the Parshendi during Gavilar's expedition into the Shattered Plains.
                    When King Gavilar was assassinated by the Parshendi in 1167, his son, Elhokar, became king and declared war on the Parshendi.

                    Alethkar isn't in the harshest of the stormlands, but neither is it some soft-skinned Western land. Buildings there are built low and squat, sturdy sides pointed eastward toward the Origin, like the shoulder of a man set and ready to take the force of an impact. Windows are placed only on the leeward - the westward - side. Like the grass and the trees there, humankind had learned to weather the storms.[6]

                    The Alethi are native to Alethkar. They follow the Vorin religion and are famous for their military heritage.

                    The Alethi class system is based on their eye color. Lighteyes are the noble, ruling class and darkeyes are the peasant, worker class. The lighteyes are ranked by dahn and the darkeyes are further ranked by nahn.
                    Amongst the Alethi, writing is a feminine art; men learn only glyphs, leaving letters and reading to their wives and sisters.
                    Ironically, mixed blood amongst the Alethi is far more common in lighteyes than darkeyes. Darkeyes rarely marry foreigners, but the Alethi houses often need alliances or money from outside.

                    Parshmen are invisible to them because they've been brought up that way.

                    They have tan skin and pure black hair. They are a grand people with a natural nobility to them.
                    Alethi hair always breeds true, proportionate to how much Alethi blood one has. Foreign blood would mean stray hairs of another color (like that of Adolin, for example).
                    The men are tall and well made. Lighteyed men dress in dark coats that are elaborately embroidered, looking like generals on a field. They wear masculine colors: maroon, navy, forest green, deep burnt orange.

                    Lighteyed women are even more splendid. They wear grand dresses, their bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men. The left sleeve of each dress is longer than the right, covering the left hand. For women of age, this is their "safehand" and it is to be covered at all times. Common darkeyed women wear a glove instead of the safepouch that lighteyed women wear.
                    Women wear their hair pinned atop their heads, either in intricate braids or in loose piles. It is often woven with ribbons or ornaments, along with gems that glow with Stormlight.

                    The Alethi are a reserved people, at least when compared with more passionate folk like the Horneaters or the Reshi.
                    An oddity about all Vorin peoples is that they overtly avoid guessing the future.
                    Hugging one's mother (for example) is a very un-Alethi behavior.
                    Alethi couples typically keep their distance in public, but Adolin had been raised by a mother with a fondness for hugs, and therefore hugs Shallan as they walk together.

                    A feast is a time of relaxation. Still, it's a breach of etiquette for a woman to approach a man if he's eating.
                    Young men at a feast often find reason to remove their coats and show off their swordsmanship.
                    Women are more modest with their displays at feasts, but they engage in them as well. They sketch, paint, do calligraphy, or play music. Yet, they keep their left hands shrouded in their sleeves, delicately creating art with their right. Some of them will attract creationspren, which will roll across the tops of their easels or tables.
                    Women's food is different from that of men. (Dalinar finds it to be distastefully sweet.)
                    To sit at the king's table at a feast is a masculine dining reservation.

                    None of their games are overtly games of chance - no dice throws, no bets on card flips. There are games of breakneck, shallowcrab fights, and - oddly - guessing games. A game like breakneck has throws and tosses, but the people wouldn't bet on the outcome.* Instead, they'd bet on the hand they held after the throws and the draws.
